Ribby and  old Lappy

Once there was a cute frog named Ribby. She was everyone's favorite and her favorite was a Laptop that she had named Lappy. Lappy was 
gifted to her by her grandmother before she passed away. She would always be using Lappy, be it to watch her favorite shows, use social 
media, or code that she loved to do. She would never get out of her room and never let Lappy rest. Lappy had become old. Her family and 
friends were worried for her. 

Ribby's obsession with Lappy intensified, as did his worries for her and the worn-out laptop. Lappy's once-bright screen had darkened,
and its overworked processor was struggling to keep up with Ribby's demands. Concerned for Ribby's safety, her relatives and friends 
interfered, persuading her to venture outside her room. Ribby needed to develop new interests and give Lappy the relaxation she needed, 
fostering a healthier balance in her life.

As Ribby's attachment to Lappy grew stronger, the laptop began to show signs of age and weariness. Its once shiny exterior was now marred 
with scratches and faded colors, mirroring the toll of countless hours spent in Ribby's embrace. Lappy's keys had lost their smoothness, their
once-joyful click reduced to a feeble and tired sound. The touchpad, once responsive and vibrant, now struggled to register Ribby's gentle 
caresses.

Lappy, like a loyal companion, had endured Ribby's unrelenting attention without complaint. It had witnessed her laughter, tears, and dreams,
faithfully bearing witness to every moment of her life. But the weight of Ribby's ceaseless demands had taken its toll on the faithful machine. Its battery, once a source of boundless energy, now dwindled quickly, struggling to keep pace with Ribby's insatiable appetite for connection.
In its weakened state, Lappy's screen flickered, as if reflecting its own waning strength. It had become dim, unable to shine with the same 
brilliance it once possessed. The fan, now clogged with dust and debris, wheezed with exhaustion, desperately trying to cool the overworked 
components within. Lappy's once-vibrant spirit seemed to fade, mirroring the ache in Ribby's heart as she witnessed her beloved companion's 
decline.

Ribby, oblivious to Lappy's silent suffering, continued to push the tired machine to its limits. But in her pursuit of digital fulfillment, 
she failed to see the toll it was taking on her loyal friend. It was time for Ribby to understand that Lappy, like any living being, needed 
care, rest, and respite. Only then could the bond between them be preserved and nurtured, allowing Ribby to discover the beauty of the world 
beyond her room while Lappy found solace in a well-deserved rest.

With the support and concern of her loved ones, Ribby finally began to realize the toll her obsession had taken on both herself and Lappy. 
As she took a step back from her constant reliance on the worn-out laptop, she started to explore new hobbies and engage in activities that 
didn't involve a screen. She discovered the joy of spending time outdoors, immersing herself in the vibrant colors of nature, and engaging 
in face-to-face interactions with friends and family. Gradually, Ribby found a renewed sense of balance in her life, nurturing her own
 well-being while also giving Lappy the rest and rejuvenation it desperately needed. Together, Ribby and Lappy embarked on a journey of 
self-discovery, forming a healthier bond that celebrated both their shared memories and their individual growth.
