Ribby and  old Lappy

Once there was a cute frog named Ribby. She was everyone's favorite and her favorite was a Laptop that she had named Lappy. Lappy was gifted to her by her grandmother before she passed away. She would always be using Lappy, be it to watch her favorite shows, use social media, or code that she loved to do. She would never get out of her room and never let Lappy rest. Lappy had become old. Her family and friends were worried for her.


As Ribby's attachment to Lappy grew stronger, the laptop began to show signs of age and weariness. Its once shiny exterior was now marred with scratches and faded colors, mirroring the toll of countless hours spent in Ribby's embrace. Lappy's keys had lost their smoothness, their once-joyful click reduced to a feeble and tired sound. The touchpad, once responsive and vibrant, now struggled to register Ribby's gentle caresses.

Lappy, like a loyal companion, had endured Ribby's unrelenting attention without complaint. It had witnessed her laughter, tears, and dreams, faithfully bearing witness to every moment of her life. But the weight of Ribby's ceaseless demands had taken its toll on the faithful machine. Its battery, once a source of boundless energy, now dwindled quickly, struggling to keep pace with Ribby's insatiable appetite for connection.

In its weakened state, Lappy's screen flickered, as if reflecting its own waning strength. It had become dim, unable to shine with the same brilliance it once possessed. The fan, now clogged with dust and debris, wheezed with exhaustion, desperately trying to cool the overworked components within. Lappy's once-vibrant spirit seemed to fade, mirroring the ache in Ribby's heart as she witnessed her beloved companion's decline.

Ribby, oblivious to Lappy's silent suffering, continued to push the tired machine to its limits. But in her pursuit of digital fulfillment, she failed to see the toll it was taking on her loyal friend. It was time for Ribby to understand that Lappy, like any living being, needed care, rest, and respite. Only then could the bond between them be preserved and nurtured, allowing Ribby to discover the beauty of the world beyond her room while Lappy found solace in a well-deserved rest.
