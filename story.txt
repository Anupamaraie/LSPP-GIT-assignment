Ribby and  old Lappy

Once there was a cute frog named Ribby. She was everyone's favorite and her favorite was a Laptop that she had named Lappy. Lappy was gifted to her by her grandmother before she passed away. She would always be using Lappy, be it to watch her favorite shows, use social media, or code that she loved to do. She would never get out of her room and never let Lappy rest. Lappy had become old. Her family and friends were worried for her.
